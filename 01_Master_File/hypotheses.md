## Business Question

> How do influencer engagement efficiency and paid-ad conversion performance each behave in e-commerce — and what do those patterns suggest about last-click attribution bias?

---

## Datasets

| Dataset | Source | Rows | What it covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| YouTube Influencer Data | YouTube Data API v3 — collected by me | **3,848 channels** (after filter) | All 4 tiers · 9 niches · 82 countries |
| Marketing A/B Testing | Kaggle (FavioVázquez) — real marketing campaign A/B test | 588,101 real users | Paid vs Organic conversion rates |

> Filter applied: `subscribers ≥ 1,000` (industry-standard nano tier lower bound). Ensures all channels represent real, discoverable creators.

## Hypotheses & Results

### H1 — Influencer Tier vs Engagement Efficiency
**"Nano influencers generate higher views per subscriber than mega influencers."**

- **Metric:** `view_per_subscriber` = total views ÷ subscriber count
- **Dataset:** YouTube API (3,848 channels)
- **Groups:** nano (< 10K) · micro (10K–100K) · macro (100K–1M) · mega (1M+)
- **Test:** Kruskal-Wallis test across all four tiers
- **Result:** Confirmed — Nano median VPS: 0.884 vs Mega: 0.326 → **2.7× advantage**
- **Significance:** p = 9.21e-263 — well past any conventional threshold
- **Why it matters:** Brands using last-click attribution undervalue nano influencers because their subscriber count looks small. The data shows they deliver more engagement per subscriber — meaning more value per euro spent.

---

### H2 — Content Niche vs Engagement Rate
**"Engagement rate varies significantly across content niches on YouTube."**

- **Metric:** `view_per_subscriber` by niche
- **Dataset:** YouTube API (3,848 channels)
- **Groups:** Fashion · Lifestyle · Beauty · Travel · Film & Streaming · Food · Gaming · Fitness · Shopping
- **Test:** Kruskal-Wallis test across niches
- **Result:** Confirmed — Fashion leads with median VPS 0.71. Fitness shows the lowest engagement.
- **Why it matters:** E-commerce brands need to know which content niches deliver the highest engagement efficiency. Fashion consistently outperforms.

---

### H3 — Channel Size vs Content Efficiency
**"Smaller influencers produce relatively more views per subscriber than larger influencers."**

- **Metric:** Log-log regression: log10(subscribers) → log10(view_per_subscriber)
- **Dataset:** YouTube API (3,848 channels)
- **Test:** Spearman correlation on log-transformed data + linear regression
- **Result:** Confirmed — Spearman r = −0.51, R² = 0.27
- **Interpretation:** Every 10× increase in subscribers → ~41% drop in views per subscriber
- **Why it matters:** Audience loyalty and content efficiency decline as channels grow. A brand investing in 10 nano creators will likely outperform one mega creator on engagement metrics.

---

### H4 — Paid Advertising vs Organic Conversion
**"Users exposed to a paid advertisement convert at a statistically significantly higher rate than users who saw no paid ad."**

- **Metric:** Conversion rate (converted = True)
- **Dataset:** Marketing A/B Testing (588,101 users)
- **Groups:** "ad" group (paid) vs "psa" group (organic baseline)
- **Test:** Chi-square test for proportions
- **Result:** Confirmed — Paid: 2.55% · Organic: 1.79% → **+43% conversion lift**
- **Significance:** p < 0.001
- **Why it matters:** Quantifies the value of paid advertising vs organic reach. Confirms that paid ads are worth the investment at the moment of conversion. (Whether influencer content does the earlier awareness work is this project's working hypothesis, not something the A/B test data itself tests — see the Methodology Note below.)

---

### H5 (Bonus) — Geographic Origin and Influencer Engagement
**"Geographic origin affects influencer engagement rates — some countries produce significantly higher VPS than others."**

- **Metric:** Median `view_per_subscriber` by country
- **Dataset:** YouTube API (3,848 channels)
- **Filter:** Minimum 10 channels per country (excludes 'Unknown' group)
- **Test:** Median comparison across countries with sufficient sample size
- **Result:** Confirmed — Top countries: **Brazil (1.12), Turkey (0.79), South Africa (0.75)**
- **Pattern:** All top countries are dominated by nano/micro creators in Fashion, Lifestyle, and Beauty niches — the same pattern seen in H1 and H2 at a country level
- **Why it matters:** For brands targeting international markets, country of origin is a meaningful filter. Nano creators in these markets outperform global averages.

---

### H6 (Bonus) — Ad Timing and Conversion Rate
**"Conversion rate varies significantly by time of day and day of week — certain windows perform significantly better."**

- **Metric:** Conversion rate by day × hour grid
- **Dataset:** Marketing A/B Testing (paid group only)
- **Test:** Heatmap analysis of conversion rate across 7 × 24 grid
- **Result:** Confirmed — Peak windows identified:
  - Saturday 5:00 AM: **5.68%** (highest in the dataset)
  - Saturday 6:00 AM: **5.16%**
  - Tuesday 4:00 PM: **4.56%**
  - Monday 2:00–3:00 PM: **4.29–4.49%**
- **Why it matters:** The same ad budget produces measurably more purchases when scheduled in these windows. Saturday early morning and Monday–Tuesday afternoon are hidden high-conversion opportunities.

## How the Two Datasets Connect

| Channel | Dataset | Key Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Influencer (nano) | YouTube API | `view_per_subscriber` = 0.884 median |
| Influencer (mega) | YouTube API | `view_per_subscriber` = 0.326 median |
| Paid advertising | A/B Testing — "ad" group | Conversion rate = 2.55% |
| Organic content | A/B Testing — "psa" group | Conversion rate = 1.79% |

**The proposed bridge (not directly tested):** Paid ads convert 43% better than organic at the moment of decision. Nano influencers deliver 2.7× more engagement per subscriber, which this project treats as a proxy for awareness-stage value. The working hypothesis is that last-click attribution credits the ad and undervalues the influencer — but since the two datasets don't share a customer journey, this is an argument the findings support, not something proven directly. See the Methodology Note below.

## Methodology Note

Direct conversion comparison between YouTube API and A/B Testing data is not possible — the datasets come from different users, products, and environments. Instead, we compare **relative efficiency metrics** (engagement lift and conversion lift) across channels, consistent with industry practice when brand-level conversion data is not publicly available.
