## A Multi-Channel Performance Analysis in E-Commerce

**Author:** Soheila Zamani
**School:** SPICED Academy Berlin — Data Analytics Bootcamp 2026
**Graduation:** April 28, 2026

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Nano creators deliver 2.7× the engagement per subscriber** of mega creators (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001)
- **Paid ads convert at 1.4× the rate of organic** — +43% lift, statistically significant on 588K users (chi-square)
- **Saturday 5–7am and Monday–Tuesday 14–16:00** are the highest-converting time windows
- **Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa** lead engagement medians across 82 countries — most influencer plans skip them

## 🎯 Business Question

> How do influencer engagement efficiency and paid-ad conversion performance each behave in e-commerce — and what do those patterns suggest about last-click attribution bias?

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Most e-commerce brands measure marketing success using **last-click attribution** — giving all the credit to the last channel a customer touched before buying. This systematically undervalues influencer content, which often starts the customer journey but rarely gets the final click.

This project analyses two real datasets to test that concern from two angles: how efficiently influencer content generates engagement across tiers and niches, and whether paid advertising converts significantly better than organic. Together, the findings suggest last-click bias is a real risk worth pricing into channel decisions — see [Limitations](#-limitations) for exactly what this data can and can't prove.

## 📊 Datasets

| # | Dataset | Source | Rows | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | YouTube Influencer Dataset | YouTube Data API v3 | 7,281 raw → **3,848 filtered** | 4 tiers, 9 niches, 82 countries |
| 2 | Marketing A/B Test | Kaggle (FavioVázquez) | **588,101 users** | Paid ad vs organic conversion |

> ⚠️ Data files are not uploaded to GitHub. See `02_Datasets/README.md` for sources and reproduction steps.
>
> Filter applied to YouTube data: `subscribers ≥ 1,000` (industry-standard nano tier lower bound) — ensures all channels represent real, discoverable creators.

## 🔬 Hypotheses & Results

| # | Hypothesis | Dataset | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Nano influencers outperform mega on engagement efficiency | YouTube | Kruskal-Wallis | ✅ **2.7× advantage** — Nano VPS 0.884 vs Mega 0.326 (p = 9.21e-263) |
| H2 | Engagement varies significantly across content niches | YouTube | Kruskal-Wallis | ✅ Fashion leads (median VPS 0.71), Fitness lowest |
| H3 | Subscriber count negatively correlates with engagement | YouTube | Spearman + Regression | ✅ r = −0.51, every 10× size increase → −41% VPS |
| H4 | Paid ads convert at a higher rate than organic | A/B Test | Chi-square | ✅ **+43% lift** — 2.55% vs 1.79% (causal, randomised) |
| H5 *(bonus)* | Geographic origin affects influencer engagement | YouTube | Median by Country | ✅ Brazil (1.12), Turkey (0.79), South Africa (0.75) lead |
| H6 *(bonus)* | Conversion rate varies by time of day and day of week | A/B Test | Conversion heatmap | ✅ Saturday 5am (5.68%), Mon–Tue 14–16:00 consistently strong |

## 🆕 New Findings (Beyond the Hypotheses)

### 4 Creator Quadrants
All 3,848 channels mapped by VPS × recency (30-day activity threshold):

| Quadrant | Description |
|---|---|
| Q1 — Dream Creators | High VPS + recently active → best partnership candidates |
| Q2 — Evergreen Creators | High VPS + less active → worth monitoring |
| Q3 — Active but Struggling | Posting often, low engagement → not recommended |
| Q4 — Fading Out | Low VPS + inactive → remove from shortlists |

### Ideal Creator Profile
**448 channels (11.6% of 3,848)** meet the data-defined ideal: top 25% VPS + uploaded within 30 days.
- Median VPS: **2.89** — 3.3× the nano average
- Top combinations: Nano × Fashion (1.777), Nano × Shopping (1.097), Nano × Travel (0.951)

## ⚠️ Limitations

The YouTube dataset and the A/B test dataset come from different users, products, and platforms — they don't share a customer journey, so this project does **not** compute or compare formal attribution models (last-click vs. linear vs. time-decay vs. data-driven) on the same conversions. Each dataset is analyzed on its own terms, with its own hypothesis tests.

What this project *does* show: two independently rigorous findings — influencer engagement efficiency and paid-ad conversion lift — that together make a data-informed case for questioning last-click bias, rather than a validated attribution model. A natural next step (not yet built) would be sourcing journey-level, multi-touchpoint data to test that case directly.
